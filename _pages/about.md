Hey, I am Liyana! :)

I’m Computer Science & Engineering graduate (Batch of 2016-20) from Government College of Engineering, Kannur. I’ve been in love with computers from a very young age. So when the time came, learning to make it dance to my tune - or, you know, function to my code - seemed like just the right choice.

Apart from computer science, college was where I got to explore community building, development, and leadership  - as well as utilize them to work towards the causes that are close to my heart. I'm currently taking a gap year before moving onto higher studies. In the meanwhile, I'll be using this little space on the web to tell my stories.

*Apart from that?*

I'm passionate about inclusion, in levelling the playing field for women in tech. I love to read. I love to write too, though this wouldn't come as a surprise. You can win my heart over with a well made cup of tea. 

Would you like to know what I am doing [now?](https://www.liyanasahir.in/now)
