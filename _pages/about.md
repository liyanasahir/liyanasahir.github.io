Hey, I am Liyana! :)

Iâ€™m a Computer Science & Engineering graduate working in the women in tech space. I'm passionate about inclusion - in levelling the playing field for the marginalized. 

I love to read. I love to write too, though this wouldn't come as a surprise. You can win my heart over with a well made cup of tea. 

Would you like to know what I am doing [now?](https://www.liyanasahir.in/now)
