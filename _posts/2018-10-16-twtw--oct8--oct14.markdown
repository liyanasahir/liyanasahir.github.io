*The first ‘The Week That Was’ after the WIT Program, and it doesn’t feel all that different yet!*

This week was all about completing the first stages of our design project — reading through papers, looking into case studies and so on. Our topic was to build a Context-based Word Indexing Model for Document Summarization (which comes as a subset of NLP).

You know how IEEE papers always look so intimidating, with the small fonts and the equations that look like they’re in foreign language? One major takeaway for me this week was that they aren’t all that scary as they seem — sure, a lot of it wouldn’t make sense in the first read (or the second or third sometimes!) but it all starts to make sense after a while. Specially if you’re ready to dive in with Google by your side.

On Thursday, my mailbox had something totally unexpected in store.

To be honest, I didn’t expect to get selected in the final rounds because there were so many girls in the cohort who I felt were equally deserving — guess it must have been a tough choice! Excited to finally get to meet everyone at GHCI this year.

After wrapping up the first stage of our presentation on Friday, it was time to start prepping for Tathva’18 — we visit NIT Calicut annually as a part of Robocek, and this time it was the same. A number of students would be taking part in the different competitions, so Saturday was a culmination of a week of hustle and bustle. Was hoping to meet [Archana N](https://medium.com/u/ed06126e1059), but then we couldn’t make it due to clash of timings!
