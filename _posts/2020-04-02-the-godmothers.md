Sometime in mid-february, I came to know about Godmothers, a project to encourage and equip promising women to attain their fullest potential.

It was a new initiative by [Arya](http://aryamurali.com) & co and as a first step, they were rolling out the Domain Name Scholarship, for female students or professionals aged between 18 and 24 to buy a domain name for their personal website.

When Arya asked me if I would like to volunteer I didn’t have to think much. I was in that stage of my life where after a continuous series of overcommitting and feeling exhausted, I was getting better at saying no. I was reminded of a blog post written by [Derek Severs](https://sivers.org/hellyeah):“*When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to really throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes you say ‘HELL YEAH!’*”.

Having been a participant in similar previous initiatives by Arya, I had faith in her vision and execution - I knew how beneficial it could potentially be. There’s also always something new to learn when working alongside people who have more experience than you.

And thus, after a series of conversations and a 45 minute call later, I was on board as the Head of Engagements for Godmothers.

In the following days, I communicated with the women who had expressed interest in the scholarship, sending updates from the godmothers along with tips to build their website. To provide context as well as guidance surrounding the scholarship, we also held a virtual conference in the weekend leading up to the submission deadline.

*The Godmothers Talk: Virtual Conference on Personal Branding & Building a Personal Website*

We kicked off the conference on March 4th through an instagram live where I interviewed [Ruby](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubypeethambaran/), one of the godmothers. It was a fun session where we discussed her [blog post](https://thegirlwrites.in/personal-branding/#comments) and talked about the importance of owning your narrative. My favorite of the conference sessions might be the one with Annie, titled ‘Career Lessons’. It’s a candid conversation between Arya and Annie where they share personal anecdotes and uncover their learnings in their respective careers, while answering the underlying question: “How will women break the glass ceilings if they are still trying to fit into the glass slippers?”

And yes, I got to speak too - a small tutorial on three ways you can build your personal website without coding. It was very satisfying to see it all came together.  If you'd like to take a look, all the sessions of the conference have been documented on the [Godmothers website](https://sites.google.com/aryamurali.com/godmothers/virtual-conference-sessions).

The Godmother Fund was put together with a small amount of money the godmothers offered to contribute from their income towards another young woman's growth. This is a revolving fund, ie, beneficiaries are expected to pay it forward in the future, thus expanding the network and bringing more women up.

The DNS scholarship application closed on March 8th, and the winners were announced a week later through our instagram page. Quite a few participants emailed back to tell that they were going ahead with building their websites anyway, which was very heart-warming. Much to my surprise, Arya told me that the scholarship was being extended to me as well - so that’s the story behind this brand new domain name. :)

In a way, there's no greater incentive to keep blogging and documenting my experiences than this. It was time to own my little space on the web, to settle down after being a wanderer all this time.
