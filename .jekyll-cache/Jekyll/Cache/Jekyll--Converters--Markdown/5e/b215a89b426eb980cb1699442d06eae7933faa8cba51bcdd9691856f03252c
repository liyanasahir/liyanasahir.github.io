I"‰<p>Hey, I am Liyana! :)</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a final year Computer Science &amp; Engineering student from Government College of Engineering, Kannur. Iâ€™ve been in love with computers from a very young age. So when the time came, learning to make it dance to my tune - or, you know, function according to my code - seemed like just the right choice.</p>

<p>Apart from computer science, college was where I got to explore different communities, development, and leadership  - as well as utilize them to work towards the causes that are close to my heart. Iâ€™m currently looking forward to take a gap year before moving onto higher studies. In the meanwhile, Iâ€™ll be using this little space on the web to tell my stories.</p>

<p><em>Apart from that?</em></p>

<p>Iâ€™m passionate about inclusion, in levelling the playing field for women in tech. I love to read. I love to write too, though this wouldnâ€™t come as a surprise. You can win my heart with a well made cup of tea. You can give me a mic and put me in front of a crowd and Iâ€™d comfortably find my way through.</p>
