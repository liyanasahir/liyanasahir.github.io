I"<p><em>I recently had to log in to my linkedin account, after a long while. It was then that I took a good hard look at my own.</em></p>

<p>As someone who has been living pretty much on the internet since I got my first laptop in 8th grade, Linkedin wasn’t new to me. But it was the “adults’ website” (no, not that kind) - a place where people with jobs went to meet other people with jobs and talked about their very adult lives - opportunities, openings, networking and the rest. It wasn’t until the first week of college, when professionals coordinating our orientation program mentioned how it was the most important place for students looking to get jobs that I actually went and created an account of my own.</p>

<p>It was still bare. Nothing to add except your educational details. After some thinking, I slowly added my two year stint as ‘Senior News Reporter’ and ‘Member of the Editorial Board’ at LightHouse, to my profile - very serious names to describe the only fun I had during my last two years of high school, running around interviewing teachers and students, photographing and preparing reports on all the events my school decided to conduct, and later recruiting a new batch of juniors to do the same.</p>

<p>It took me a year more to get the account into better shape, prompted by Arya when I got selected to be a part of the first cohort of girls for the Women In Tech program by Rethink. By then, I had a few more experiences to add to my profile. Atthri (who was a senior, mentor figure, and the student chairman of ISTE GCEK at the time) helped me spruce it up with all the right words.</p>

<p>Over the course of the WIT program, I had to reach out to a number of excellent women in tech, and I know now that having a well maintained Linkedin definitely helped in establishing my credibility. I knew that if anyone were to search for me, Linkedin would pop up first, and they would discover a face to put next to my name, and see a neat list of organizations I have been a part of. Over the vast expanse of the internet, to know that the person who reached out to you does exist as she claims - that would definitely put people at ease. I banked on it over the course of the next two years, while I had to reach out and connect with people for various events in college.</p>

<p>But I was discovering more of me along the way, recharting my directions and figuring out new paths to take up. If you had told me in my first year of engineering that in the end I would decide not to sit for placements at all, I would have laughed at your face at the impossibility of such a statement. And yet… here we are.</p>

<p>One day not too long ago, I took a good hard look at my account. A neat list of items, too sanitized from their history. My Linkedin would tell you I was Chairperson of ISTE GCEK between Aug 2018 and 2019, but not that I lost roughly 12 kgs during the same interval of time, without me even realizing it. It would tell you I was Curator for a TEDx event in 2018, but not that I had to take to the stage as hostess at the last minute, shaking and stuttering under the spotlight that blinded me when I stood under it for the first time. If you scroll some more, you’ll see close to the bottom that I was briefly the Technical Coordinator for Robocek - probably my first responsibility in college, managing a workshop, teaching juniors how to code, all while trying not to feel like an imposter myself.</p>

<p>I know I’ve come a long way since then.</p>

<p>My profile hadn’t been updated in a long while, definitely not since 2019. Nothing to speak for my last two years, beyond roles and dates. I stared at my byline which I didn’t remember adding - ‘Lead Student Coordinator at SHE’. The words weren’t entirely enough to describe everything I had been doing under SHE, and yet I couldn’t think of anything better to encapsulae the nebulous, all encompassing way in which SHE had grown to be a big and unexpected part of my college life in its very last months. And with graduation looming, that was ending too, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>I know Linkedin is an integral part of your online presence, more so for a recent engineering graduate. But right now, I feel it doesn’t represent me accurately enough, or all that I stand for. While I stand at these crossroads facing a gap year, trying to figure out where I want to be and experimenting new things, I want to feel a little less constrained to the identities of me that exist outside of me, a little less pressurized to follow a certain course.</p>

<p>Having made that decision, I was caught staring at my homepage, seeing some familiar names after a long while. It was nice to see updates from people I had studied with in high school, people with whom I’ve been long out of touch, to see where they had finally decided to land after graduation (or to take off from - we are fresh graduates, after all). It was nice to see all the updates from my college clubs, and to see how students were interacting with these pages and making their own presence felt. It filled me with warmth to see them embracing their achievements, something that still feels taboo to a lot of us.</p>

<p>I’ll be back someday soon  - a week? a month? several months? who knows? - when I am ready to navigate the rest of whatever is ahead for me.</p>

<p>But until then, I guess it’s goodbye.</p>
