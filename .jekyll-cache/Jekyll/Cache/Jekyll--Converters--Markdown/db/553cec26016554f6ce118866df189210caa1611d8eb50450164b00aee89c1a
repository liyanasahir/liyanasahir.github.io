I"û<p>Hey, I am Liyana! :)</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a final year Computer Science &amp; Engineering student from Government College of Engineering, Kannur. Iâ€™ve been in love with computers from a very young age. So when the time came, learning to make it dance to my tune - or, you know, function according to my code - seemed like just the right choice.</p>

<p>For the past couple years, Iâ€™ve been exploring my interests in robotics, web-development, and image processing. I like carrying my learning forward - Iâ€™ve facilitated classes in C, Python, Arduino programming, Computer Vision and Machine Learning using Tensorflow. College was also where I got to explore development and leadership as well as utilize them to work towards the causes that are close to my heart.</p>

<p><em>Apart from that?</em></p>

<p>Iâ€™m passionate about <strong>inclusion</strong>, in levelling the playing field for women in tech.</p>

<p>You can give me a mic and put me in front of a crowd and Iâ€™d comfortably find my way through.</p>

<p>I love to read. I love to write too, though this wouldnâ€™t come as a surprise.</p>

<p>You can win my heart with a well made cup of chai.</p>
