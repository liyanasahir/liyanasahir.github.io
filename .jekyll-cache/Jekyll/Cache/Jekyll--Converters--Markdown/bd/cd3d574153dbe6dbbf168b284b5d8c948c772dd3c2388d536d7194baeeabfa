<p>Before working with Telegramâ€™s API, you need to get your own API ID and hash:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Follow <a href="https://my.telegram.org/">this link</a> and login with your phone number.</li>
  <li>Click under API Development tools.</li>
  <li>A <em>Create new application</em> window will appear. Fill in your application details. There is no need to enter any <em>URL</em>, and only the first two fields (<em>App title</em> and <em>Short name</em>) can currently be changed later.</li>
  <li>Click on <em>Create application</em> at the end. Remember that your <strong>API hash is secret</strong> and Telegram wonâ€™t let you revoke it. Donâ€™t post it anywhere!
