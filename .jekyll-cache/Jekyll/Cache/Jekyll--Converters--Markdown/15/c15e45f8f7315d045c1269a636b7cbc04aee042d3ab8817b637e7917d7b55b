I"Ð<p><em>The first â€˜The Week That Wasâ€™ after the WIT Program, and it doesnâ€™t feel all that different yet!</em></p>

<p>This week was all about completing the first stages of our design projectâ€Šâ€”â€Šreading through papers, looking into case studies and so on. Our topic was to build a Context-based Word Indexing Model for Document Summarization (which comes as a subset of NLP).</p>

<p>You know how IEEE papers always look so intimidating, with the small fonts and the equations that look like theyâ€™re in foreign language? One major takeaway for me this week was that they arenâ€™t all that scary as they seemâ€Šâ€”â€Šsure, a lot of it wouldnâ€™t make sense in the first read (or the second or third sometimes!) but it all starts to make sense after a while. Specially if youâ€™re ready to dive in with Google by your side.</p>

<p>On Thursday, my mailbox had something totally unexpected in store.</p>

<p>To be honest, I didnâ€™t expect to get selected in the final rounds because there were so many girls in the cohort who I felt were equally deservingâ€Šâ€”â€Šguess it must have been a tough choice! Excited to finally get to meet everyone at GHCI this year.</p>

<p>After wrapping up the first stage of our presentation on Friday, it was time to start prepping for Tathvaâ€™18â€Šâ€”â€Šwe visit NIT Calicut annually as a part of Robocek, and this time it was the same. A number of students would be taking part in the different competitions, so Saturday was a culmination of a week of hustle and bustle. Was hoping to meet <a href="https://medium.com/u/ed06126e1059">Archana N</a>, but then we couldnâ€™t make it due to clash of timings!</p>
