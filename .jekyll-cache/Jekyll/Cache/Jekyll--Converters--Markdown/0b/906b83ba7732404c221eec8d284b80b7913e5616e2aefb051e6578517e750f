I"V<p>The <em>Grace Hopper Celebration India</em> is Asia’s largest gathering of women technologists. It is produced by AnitaB.org and presented in partnership with ACM <em>India</em>. This year, GHCI took place between 14th and 16th November in Bangalore, and I was lucky enough to witness what this celebration was all about.</p>

<p>Each year, AnitaB.org awards scholarships for final year students to be a part of the event. Being a pre-final year student, I got the opportunity to be a part of this event through the WIT Program by Rethink Foundation — after 4 weeks of interesting activities, five of us were presented with the conferences passes. The rest were also encouraged to crowd-fund so as not to miss this chance this time — and the three days at GHCI were completely worth all the effort put in, I’d say!</p>

<p>The first day focused mainly on the inaugural and keynote sessions, with AnitaB.org explaining their vision of brining 50–50 by 2025 and the people who are actively working on bridging it. The keynote sessions were delivered enchantingly by Lori Beer and Vaishali Kasture — with interesting anecdotes, they talked about the gender gap in technology and their experience in the field of tech.</p>

<p>It was right that day that I got to realize the power of GHCI — I got to meet recent graduates who have been working in tech companies, those who were finding the work life comfortable but at the same time exploring the possibilities of higher studies, as well as people who have been working in the field for over 12 years and thinking about switching career tracks. Each with wide ranging and equally worthwhile stories of their own, and a gathering that facilitated such connections to be forged — I knew then that this was a one of a kind experience that I was about to have.</p>

<p>The second and third days had a lot going on simultaneously — talks and workshops, and the career fair were the main attractions. There were tech tracks by experts in those fields, speaking about their experience building those technology, about the possibilities that could be explored and so on. The career fair was an eye-opening experience of its own: companies like Google and Microsoft had their stalls set up so you could readily walk up and talk to their engineers about their jobs and get a first hand experience of what it’s like to work there. You can also apply for their openings, after which they’ll shortly get back to you. I’ve known about people who have had interviews and gotten selected on the spot!</p>

<p>GHCI18 was all about getting to see the girls I’ve gotten to know online for the first time in flesh and blood. The WIT girls along with <a href="aryamurali.com">Arya</a> were quite an unparalleled bunch — the combined energy and drive was just amazing! I also got to meet Amrita, who was my guide during the WIT program on the first day of GHCI — the meeting was unfortunately cut short as I had to catch the shuttle back to metro.</p>

<p>Attending GHCI as a pre-final year student had its own perks too — though the career fair focuses on recent graduates/final year students, it was still a great opportunity to get to know what skills need to be cultivated to bring out your best version well in advance. Just hearing about the experiences of women from different areas of tech, those with a lot of experience and those who have just gone through the figuring it out process, was amazing in and of itself! The sense of peace and calm, and the confidence that you attain at the end of the day is just inexplicable.</p>

<p>GHCI is a must-attend event for all women in tech. At the end of three days of discovery, I’m happy to take home a bunch of beautiful experiences, friendships and of course — goodies. :)</p>
