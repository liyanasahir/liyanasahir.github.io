I"a<p><em>Sometime in mid-february, I came to know about Godmothers, a project to encourage and equip promising women to attain their fullest potential.</em></p>

<p>It was a new initiative by Arya &amp; co. and as a first step, they were rolling out the Domain Name Scholarship: for female students or professionals aged between 18 and 24 to buy a domain name for their personal website.</p>

<p>When Arya asked me if I would like to volunteer, I didn‚Äôt have to think much:</p>
<ol>
  <li>As a recipient of such previous initiatives by Arya, I had first hand experience  - so I had faith in her vision and execution and knew how beneficial it could potentially be</li>
  <li>There‚Äôs always something new to learn when working alongside people who had more experience than you</li>
</ol>

<p>I was in that stage of my life where after a continuous series of overcommitting and feeling exhausted, I was getting better at saying no. Like Derek Severs <a href="https://sivers.org/hellyeah">says</a>, ‚Äú<em>When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to really throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes you say ‚ÄòHELL YEAH!‚Äô</em>‚Äù. And hence, after a series of conversations on Instagram and a 45 minute call later, I was on board as the Head of Engagements for Godmothers.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the coming days, I mainly communicated with the people who had expressed interest in the scholarship - sending updates from the godmothers along with tips to build their website. To provide context as well as guidance, we also held a virtual conference in the weekend leading up to the deadline.</p>

<p>We kicked it off on March 4th through an instagram live where I interviewed Ruby, one of the godmothers. It was a fun session where we discussed her <a href="https://thegirlwrites.in/personal-branding/#comments">blog post</a> and talked about the importance of owning your narrative. My favorite of the conference sessions was the one with Annie, titled ‚ÄòCareer Lessons‚Äô. It‚Äôs a candid chat between Arya and Annie where they share personal anecdotes and uncover their learnings in their respective careers, while answering the underlying question: ‚ÄúHow will women break the glass ceilings if they are still trying to fit into the glass slippers?‚Äù</p>

<p>And yes, I got to talk too - a small tutorial on three ways you can build your personal website without coding. All the sessions of the conference have been documented on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/aryamurali.com/godmothers/virtual-conference-sessions">Godmothers website</a>.</p>

<p>The Godmother fund is put together with a small amount of money the godmothers have offered to contribute towards another young woman‚Äôs growth. This is a revolving fund, where beneficiaries agree to pay it forward in the future, building more people up.</p>

<p>The DNS scholarship application closed on March 8th, and the winners were announced a week later through our instagram page. Around this time, Arya told me that the scholarship was being extended to me as well - so that‚Äôs the story behind this brand new domain name!</p>

<p>This blog was built using Jekyll and hosted using Github Pages. I‚Äôve been planning to take a gap year all along, so I can‚Äôt imagine a greater incentive to keep blogging and documenting my experiences than this one.</p>
